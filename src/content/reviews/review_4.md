title: "AMAZING VISIT FOR MY HUSBAND'S BIRTHDAY!"
order: "4"
description: "We were made to feel welcome from the moment we entered the hotel. The doormen knew who we were before we'd set foot inside, and it's touches like this that really make a stay special. Kim checked us in, she was so warm and friendly it was just a wonderful experience."
