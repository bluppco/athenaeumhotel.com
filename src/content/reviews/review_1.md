title: "always the best!"
order: "1"
description: "We work in London and have two of our children living in London at present we always choose to stay at The Athenaeum whether it's business or pleasure, together or alone, with family or friends. Primarily it is the service. The people could not be more hospitable or warm - you feel like you're part of a family (minus the arguments and politics) and that feels amazing. Nothing is ever too much trouble and the food is sublime."
